# Diagnostic Process: AI Struggle Analysis Flowchart

## Visual Concept
A systematic flowchart guiding readers through the three-step diagnostic process for analyzing AI struggles.

## Diagram Flow

### Starting Point
**Element:** "AI Struggling in Codebase Area?"
- Diamond decision shape
- Yes/No branches

### Step 1: Pattern Identification
**Visual Elements:**
- Rectangle box with "Step 1: Pattern Identification"
- Three sub-actions:
  - "Document Struggle Patterns" (with notebook icon)
  - "Categorize Issues" (with filing cabinet icon)
  - "Map to Code Structures" (with network/mapping icon)
- Output: "Documented Problem Areas"

### Step 2: Software Principle Analysis
**Visual Elements:**
- Rectangle box with "Step 2: Software Principle Analysis"
- Seven principle checkpoints in smaller boxes:
  - Modularity
  - Encapsulation
  - Single Responsibility
  - Interface Segregation
  - KISS
  - YAGNI
  - High Cohesion, Low Coupling
- Output: "Quality Assessment Report"

### Step 3: AI-Assisted Analysis
**Visual Elements:**
- Rectangle box with "Step 3: AI-Assisted Analysis"
- Three sub-actions:
  - "Principle-Based Assessment" (with checklist icon)
  - "Structural Evaluation" (with magnifying glass icon)
  - "Refactoring Plan Generation" (with blueprint icon)
- Output: "Actionable Improvement Plan"

### Decision Point
**Element:** "Quality Issues Identified?"
- Diamond decision shape
- If No: "Monitor and Document" (loop back to start)
- If Yes: Proceed to "Strategic Refactoring"

### End Point
**Element:** "Strategic Refactoring Approaches"
- Rounded rectangle leading to next process

## Visual Design Notes
- Use consistent color coding: Blue for steps, Green for outputs, Red for decision points
- Include icons for each major action to make it scannable
- Add arrows showing the flow direction
- Include feedback loop from monitoring back to pattern identification
- Use different shapes: Rectangles for processes, Diamonds for decisions, Rounded rectangles for start/end

## Implementation Notes
- Make it printable as a reference guide
- Consider creating a checklist version alongside the flowchart
- Include time estimates for each step (e.g., "15-30 minutes")

## Placement in Article
Insert after "The Diagnostic Process" section introduction to provide visual guidance before diving into the detailed steps.
