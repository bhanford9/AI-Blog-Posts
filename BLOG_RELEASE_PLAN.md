## Link Management Strategy

### **Primary Approach: Placeholder with Coming Soon**

Replace links to unpublished posts with:

```markdown
**[Post Title]** (Coming Soon - Part [X] of the AI Coding Mastery Series)
```

**Example Implementation:**
```markdown
<!-- Before Release -->
[Planning-First Methodology](https://bhanford9.github.io/AI-Blog-Posts/planning-first-ai-methodology-foundation)

<!-- During Staged Release -->
**Planning-First Methodology** (Coming Soon - Part 2 of the AI Coding Mastery Series)

<!-- After Release -->
[Planning-First Methodology](https://bhanford9.github.io/AI-Blog-Posts/planning-first-ai-methodology-foundation)
```

### **Alternative Approaches**

#### **Option 2: Related Content Sections**
```markdown
## Coming in This Series
- **Planning-First Methodology** - Systematic approaches for reliable AI collaboration
- **Measuring AI Impact** - Quantify productivity improvements with concrete metrics
```

#### **Option 3: Placeholder Anchors**
```markdown
<!-- Will become active when post is published -->
[Planning-First Methodology](#coming-soon-part-2) 
```
